Just run wallpaper, it creates a background folder in your .config and moves the engine subscripts there.

To uninstall, just delete wallpaper and the ~/.config/background folder.

This script will search Google/Deviantart/AnimeGalleries for you, and set the image as your backround at intervals of 2-200 minutes.
Currently works with:

Caja
Nautilus
PCmanFM
Feh
Xfce

If anybody wants another one, ask and I will "try" to get it to work.
